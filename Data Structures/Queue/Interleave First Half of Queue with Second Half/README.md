# Interleave the first half of the queue with second half

Given a queue of integers of even length, rearrange the elements by interleaving the first half of the queue with the second half of the queue.

Only a stack can be used as an auxiliary space.

## Examples:

```
Input :  1 2 3 4
Output : 1 3 2 4

Input : 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
Output : 11 16 12 17 13 18 14 19 15 20
```
